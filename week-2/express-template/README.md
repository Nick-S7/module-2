what you should do once you get this template

steps

1. in folder that shows package.json you should ' npm install '

    > this will install all packages and create your node_modules

2. touch .env

    > this will create a .env file which holds your private environment variables and any other variables that you want to keep secret when you push your app to github

3. check the .gitignore to assure that you have '.env' and 'node_modules' set to be ignored when you push to a repo
